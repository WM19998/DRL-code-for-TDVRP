# Deep attention models with dimension-reduction and gate mechanisms for solving practical time-dependent vehicle routing problems

This is DRL-code for TDVRP:
ModelA.zip: Model a shown in Figure 1(a), 
ModelB.zip: Model b shown in Figure 1(b).

For more details, please see our paper Deep attention models with dimension-reduction and
gate mechanisms for solving practical time-dependent
vehicle routing problems which has been accepted at Transportation Research Part E. If this code is useful for your work, please cite our paper.
